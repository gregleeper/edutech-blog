I began working on technology in education in January 2011. I have seen our district change from several labs in each building along with a handful of classroom computers to 1:1 Macbook Air in grades 3-12. This coming year, our district will be undergoing another change. We will be moving all students to iPad. That's grades K-12.

Moving to iPad will require a change in mindset by both teachers and students. I am hoping this blog will be a worthwhile location to visit when trying to make those adjustments.

Some of those topics I'm planning on writing about are:

- **Cloud storage:** iCloud, Google Drive
- **Classroom management:** Mosyle Manager, Apple Classroom
- **Storage management:** Local storage
- **Creativity:** Presentation tools
